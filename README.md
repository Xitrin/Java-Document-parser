Application parses through document library "cacm.all" with invert.java and creates a file with each Term and appropriate Term Frequency from the original Document library and also apropriate files for Authors and Titles, excluding predetermined list of common words. It also creates a posting list file with more detailed information about each term using postList.java.

Then it is possible to retrieve term and all the Document IDs where term appeared, the term frequency in each document and position of the term in the document. Test.java looks through created Dictionary file and finds term and appropriate Term Frequency and then looks through created PostList file and finds additional information. App checks for special characters in the input and informs the user about wrong or not working queries or using input "zzend" to exit.
